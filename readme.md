Speech to Braille Translator and Sign Language Recognition System 

The purpose of this project is to provide a system that will allow people with special needs to access audio-video content. This system will convert speech to Braille and detect signs in order to teach Sign Language. This could be a great asset to those who are deaf and blind, as well as to Sign Language Coaches, NGOs, and Braille Publishing Companies.

## Speech To Braille

This system will convert spoken words or written text to Braille and print the same, making it easier for the blind to access audio-video content. The system consists of the following steps: 

1. Loading Audio File
2. Audio to Text
3. Text to Braille

## Sign Language Detection

This system will detect signs in order to teach Sign Language. The system consists of the following steps:

1. Realtime Video Input
2. Sign Detection
3. Output Letter

## Why this project is needed?

This system serves an important purpose by providing an accessible way for the deaf and blind to stay up to date with the latest trends in education and politics. It also provides a two-way approach, allowing normally-abled people to learn braille script and sign language so they may be of help to the deaf and blind.

## Modelling

* The Speech Recognition System includes Word Sense Disambiguation, Speech Tagging, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
* The Hand Sign Recognition System includes OpenCV, Media Pipe Holistic, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model.

## Results

* The Audio File is first converted to text, followed by the text being converted to Braille.
* The Sign Language Detection System will output a letter corresponding to the sign shown.

## Conclusion

This project is a great asset to those who are deaf and blind, as well as to Sign Language Coaches, NGOs, and Braille Publishing Companies. The Speech and Sign Language Recognition System will make it easier for the differently-abled to access audio-video content, thereby bridging the gap between them and modern society.
